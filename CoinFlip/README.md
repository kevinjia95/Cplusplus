DESCRIPTION OF PROGRAM

This is a program that simulates a game where 3 boys flip a coin from their bag of a user-defined number of coins. The boy with the odd side up gets a coin from each of the other two boys. This continues until one boy has all of the coins. The game then calculates and outputs the average number of turns per game.

User inputs:
	Number of coins each boy starts with
	The fairness of the coin landing on heads
	Number of games the boys will play



To compile, run "make". Then launch the program with "./broke".
